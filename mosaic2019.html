    Mosaic is the first event of the academic year and it merges fun with technology.
    It’s an event where all the committees of the college conduct fun and innovative games using their skills in technology and arts and crafts.
    CSI conducted a total of three games this year –  <br>
    Avengers: infinity quest  <br>  
    Sacred games : aham brahmasmi  <br>
    Black mirror : shut up and dance scavengers hunt <br>
    <br> <br>
    The Avengers : infinity quest consisted of 6 different minigames like a technical questionnaire, lemon on the spoon race, virtual reality Minecraft, arranging the movies in order, etc. wherein after completing each game the team would collect infinity stones. The team who collected all the stones with the maximum amount of points were declared winners.
    <br>
    Scared games : aham brahmasmi consisted of two rounds. In the first round the participants have to go on a QR code based treasure hunt to find guruji. Teams who qualified the first round would move onto the second round where they had to undergo various hurdles related to the series like dialogue guessing and guess the title reference.
    <br>
    Black mirror : shut up and dance was a scavengers hunt where about 8-10 tasks were given to each team. After the completion of each task the teams had to provide proof so that they could proceed to the next level. The team to complete the tasks in the shortest amount of time was declared as the winner.
     <br>
    The winners of the games were provided certificates for participation and a cash prize.
    <br>
    CSI SFIT saw about over 200 participants and was one the most successful committees at mosaic 2019-20. 
    This event couldn’t have been a success if it weren’t for the efforts of all the members of the committee and a few volunteers. They’ve worked for over a week almost all day in planning the games and making all the props. 
    And hence I would like to end this report by appreciating and thanking all the members and volunteers for the work they put in to make this event a success.
