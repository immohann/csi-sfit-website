 	 <p>A workshop on Augmented Reality was organized by the Computer Society of India - SFIT on the 1st and 2nd of October, 2017, in association with TechCryptors. It was attended by 56 students in total. The workshop was conducted by Mr. Anurag Mishra.
Day 1
All the students gathered at the CAD lab at 10:00 A.M. Mr. Anurag Mishra started the session with briefing the students about Augmented Reality. He went on to brief the students about the Vuforia plug-in used to implement Augmented Reality. He then demonstrated the students how to place a moving dinosaur over a Rs. 100 note. A lunch break was given from 12:30 P.M. â€“ 1:30 P.M. Post lunch, the students used the concepts learned while implementing the Moving Dinosaurs project to place Christmas gifts on the Rs. 100 note and used custom animations and scripts to animate the Christmas gifts on click. The session ended at 5 P.M.
Day 2
The session on Day 2 was held in the CAD lab and began at 10:00 AM. It was conducted by Mr. Anurag Mishra. He began with the revision of the previous session and in that he solved the various doubts the students had from the previous session. The students began with a new project where the students were given a restaurant menu card and were shown how to place 3D models of the food items on the menu card. This was accompanied with a brief description of the food item. The lunch break was then given from 1P.M.-2 P.M. After the lunch break, Mr. Anurag Mishra solved some doubts which the students had over the course of the workshop. Later, Mr. Anurag Mishra demonstrated another project where the students were given two sheets which when brought together would result in lightning and thunderstorm animations. Mr. Anurag Mishra explained the scripts behind these custom animations, thereby allowing the students to go ahead and do their own modifications to the project.
All the participants were provided with participation certificates and useful links for reference about the content taught in the two days of the workshop. The links which would definitely help the students to apply the concepts learned in the workshop in interesting ways.
