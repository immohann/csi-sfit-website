 	 <p>A GFX workshop was conducted by Computer Society of India-SFIT on the 8th and 9th of February, 2020. It was attended by a total of 25 students in total. The workshop instructor was Mr. Anshul Deodia. Day 1 the students gathered in the ARC room at 10:00 AM. Mr Anshul Deodia started the workshop by giving a brief about Video Editing and the application used i.e. ‘Premier Pro’. He then went on to show an example of what could possibly be achieved at the end of the workshop. The session was started by showing the students a few basic tools of Premier pro that would be used like ‘cutting’, ‘importing’, etc. After the students were thought the basic tools of the application, Mr Anshul Deodia went on to teach them how to do a ‘Sky replacement’. There was a break provided at 1:00 PM which lasted till 2:00 PM. After the break the students gathered in the ARC once again. The students were thought how to join to different video and how to add transitions between them. Different types of transitions were tried out by the students. Towards the end of Day1 at 3:00 PM the students were given a task to perform which would be continued in the last 2 hours of Day 2. The task consisted of making a video of their own, the students were divided into groups of 4-5. They explored the SFIT campus to gather footage for the video they were to make. They gathered in the Arc at 4:00 PM. They discussed and edited the footages they gathered for 1 hour, at 5:00 PM Day 1 was ended. 
     Day 2 he students gathered in the ARC at 10:00 AM. On Day 2 Mr Anshul Deodia started the session by giving a quick recap of Day1 and solving some doubts regarding Day 1. The students were thought to add different effects to a video. Students were given time to try and experiment on each effect just after it being though. The next hour of the workshop Mr. Anshul Deodia thought the students about ‘key frames’ and their many uses. The students took their time understanding it, and its uses. There was a break given at 1:00-2:00 PM. The students gathered at the ARC once again. Mr Anshul Deodia proceeded with the workshop by teaching hoe to add different sound effects to videos. The students were then thought how to increase or decrease the speed of a video and also how to make a cinematography effect. The students were also thought hoe to put texts in a video and make credits scene. At 3:00 Pm the students were instructed to continue their task from Day 2. The students went on to do so till 4:45. After 4:45 the students were told to submit their video. A presentation was made of the videos made by each group. The group that created the best video was given ‘Kit-Kats’ as a prize.
     The volunteers of the group include Ms. Shivani Raul-Creative head, Mr. Gaurav Suvarna-Creative Executive and Mr Shivam Sinha-Technical Head. The volunteers performed admirably. They would always do their best to solve any of the doubts raised by the students as did Mr Anshul Deodia.
