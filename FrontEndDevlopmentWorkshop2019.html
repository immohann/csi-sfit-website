 	 <p>A workshop on Front end development was organized by the Computer Society of India -
    SFIT on the 12th and 13th of October, 2019, which was taken by Ms. Jayashree Domala(CSI
    chairperson) and Mr. Manmohan Dogra(CSI joint technical head) . It was attended by 67
    students in total. A report for the same is as follows:
   
     <br>
    All the students gathered at the ARC centre at 10:30 A.M. Mr Mohan started the session by
    briefing the students about the basic pillars of Web designing. He started with teaching how to
    Bootstraps. All students who had their personal laptops were made to install this software and
    the rest used the computer in the lab which had the software already downloaded. Using
    Bootstraps and by implementing simple HTML CSS codes a landing page was developed.
    A lunch break was given from 01:30 P.M. – 02:30 P.M. Post lunch, whatever was taught from
    the start of the session was revised by the speakers. The session for Day 1 ended at 05:00 pm
    with students learning the basic usage of Bootstraps and HTML CSS.
    
    <br>
    Day 2 started at 10.00 A.M. and where Mr Mohan started with where he had stopped the day
    before. He started by introducing JavaScript to the students. Basic introduction of JS, as well as
    its usage, was taught within the time period. A lunch break was given from 01:30 P.M. – 02:30
    P.M. Post lunch, whatever was introduced in the previous session was put to use. Font
    Awesome concept was implemented by the speakers since Font Awesome is a font and icon
    toolkit based on CSS. Font Awesome gives a wide application in the Web Development sector and
    hence the students were taught its concept and application. By the end of the session, students
    were guided on how to make a full-fledged website on their own by utilizing the concepts learned
    throughout the seminar. Mr Mohan was very active while teaching all the topics. He readily
    solved the doubts of the students and proceeded accordingly. That’s how our seminar ended
    well and students had a productive and nourishing experience in the workshop.</p>
